  <h1>Who are we?</h1>

  <h2 class='whoo'> Daniel</h2>
  <p class='whoo'>Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Daniel works every day with the coding of KirkCorp and keeping its promises up to par. Daniel enjoys spending time with his friends and family aside from work, and loves to sit back, relax, and enjoy the beach.</p>
  <p class='whoo'>When he is not with his family and not in work, Daniel enjoys fishing for salmon in the Yemen. He shops only the best brands but only buys clothes that have a price that is a multiple of 11. This is because he is apart of the elite and secret community of the Elevengers. If you want to speak to them about numbers one to ten, I would avoid it. </p>

  <h2 class='whoo'> Eileen</h2>
  <p class='whoo'>Born and raised in the Amanda Show Studio, she works consistantly and unvariably at annoying Daniel using a Russian accent. Eileen enjoys taking her kids to Alabama to view her historic backgorund and lineage.</p>
  <p class='whoo'> When she is not annoying Daniel, Eileen paints portraits of Alaskan Huskies and sells them to benefit the Universal Rabies Society.
